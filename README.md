Open the terminal, go to the SimpleDB_2.10 folder.
Firstly open a terminal to execute the server.sh script, which would open the SimpleDB server.
Then open another terminal to execute the client.sh script, which would open a SimpleDB client.
In the client terminal, you can type-in any sql syntax to execute, and the results would be displayed.
Note: SimpleDB database dont use ";" symbol. Plese don't add ";" symbol on the end of your SQL queries.

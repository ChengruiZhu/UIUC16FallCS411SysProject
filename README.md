We implemented a Graph search algorithm in the SimpleDB. The SimpleDB is able to store “Graph” structure. The SimpleDB is also able to do a heuristics search algorithm in a given graph. 

Open the terminal, go to the SimpleDB_2.10 folder.
Firstly open a terminal to execute the `server.sh` script, which would open the SimpleDB server.
Then open another terminal to execute the `client.sh` script, which would open a SimpleDB client.
In the client terminal, you can type-in any sql syntax to execute, and the results would be displayed.
Note: SimpleDB database dont use ";" symbol. Please DO NOT add ";" symbol on the end of your SQL queries.
